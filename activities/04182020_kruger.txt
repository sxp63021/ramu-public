Visit to Kruger National Park

Great news for children and wildlife enthusiasts ! During lock down, 
The Kruger National Park in South Africa is doing 2 safari drives a day, 
which you can watch live on YouTube. 
Morning drive is 5.30-8.30am and 
Afternoon drive is 3.30-6.30pm. 
It's very interesting and informative, and questions pop up and are 
answered by the game rangers. It's really lovely to watch. :)
